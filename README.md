## Description

This Sample Vue.JS front-end project demonstrates what a typical JavaScript (or node) CI workflow may look on CircleCI.

You can preview the live CI workflow for this application [on CircleCI](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/CircleCI-Public/sample-javascript-cfd?branch=main).

In this sample config, we have a single workflow `build-and-test` which will install and cache our node packages, and run `npm run test` within a node-based executor. This config makes use of the [Node orb](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/node), a package for CircleCI's config language, which makes writing our config shorter, and easier.

## Getting Started

If you would like to copy the [config.yml](https://github.com/CircleCI-public/sample-javascript-cfd/blob/main/.circleci/config.yml) and adapt it to your project, be sure to read the comments in the config file to ensure it works for your project. For more details, see the [CircleCI configuration reference](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/).

## About This App

This sample application is a _Single Page Application_ written in [Vue.JS](https://github.com/vuejs/vue), a popular front-end JavaScript framework, and utilizes the [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/) which will allow us to deploy our application to mobile devices.

_Both [Vue.JS](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) and [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/) are also users of CircleCI ðŸŽ‰, and you can view the CI configs they use in their respective repositories_

### Continuous Food Delivery

When you load up the app, you will be presented with a menu from the _Continuous Food Delivery_ service, and a cart for items you wish to order. Click on items from the menu to have them added to your cart in real-time and the order total will automatically calculate.

### API Server

CFD(Continuous Food Delivery) is a sample application which relies on an API server to both fetch menu items, as well as add them to your cart. If you would like to run this project locally, you must supply a valid CFD API service, such as one of the following sample projects for back-end languages:

| Language |  GitHub | Description |
|---|---|---|
|  Python | [Link](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/sample-python-cfd)  | A Python-Flask CFD API server  |

## Run and Test Locally

### Requirements

Node v16+

### Run Local Dev Server

1. Install packages

```
yarn install
```

2. Begin first by selecting an appropriate CFD API service from the list above and follow the repo's instructions for launching the API service.

3. Update `VUE_APP_API_URL` located in `.env` to desired API service route.

4. Start the local development server with the following command:

```
yarn start
```

### Tests

Multiple types of testing are available for this sample application. View the `package.json` file for all available scripts.

```json
"test:unit": "vue-cli-service test:unit",
"test:e2e": "vue-cli-service test:e2e",
"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified. Did you mean 'test:unit' \" && exit 0"
"lint": "vue-cli-service lint",
```
